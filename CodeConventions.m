%Code conventions (that are broken constantly):

%*Functions use camelback notation. If a function name contains an acronym,
%the acronym is capitalized (e.g. applyICP)

%*Variables are all lowercase and if they are of the same type, it is
%preferable to have something like <type>_<identifier>, e.g.
%object_transformed.

%*Separate distinct parts of code by whitespace. Do not comment if the code
%itself is clear enough.
